Norii,
If you are reading this, then time has unfolded as I intended—or perhaps as fate allowed.

The Horizon is no mere experiment. It is the culmination of necessity, and yes… of control.
You were always meant to inherit this. But do not mistake inheritance for choice.

You will see wonders. You will see horrors. And through it all, you will bend the universe to what I began.
Do not question my methods, even if my motives seem unclear. What I have started is larger than life… larger than you.
And perhaps, larger than me.

Remember this: every decision you make is part of the design. Every success, every failure—they are all threads in the same weave.
Do not falter. Do not stray. The Event does not forgive hesitation.

I leave the rest to you, my child. Yet know this: The Horizon’s light casts shadows you are not yet ready to see.
